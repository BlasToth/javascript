# Add ONE Counter

## I created this simple app to be able to keep track of my workouts but a friend is using it to count cells in the laboratory as well

### Functions: 
- add one pressing the + sign

### What I learned: 
- Node.textContent
- deploy the app using Firebase hosting
- style (gradients, transitions, animations)
