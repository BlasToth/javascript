# What I learned?
## Objects
- Object Literals
- Dot Notation vs. Bracket Notation
- methods
- THIS (context object) (if it used in the root of the document, it will refer to the global context: window object)
- arrow functions work differently with the THIS keyword
(if an arrow function is used, JS does NOT change the value of THIS to the object)
- shorthand syntax to write methods (functions) in objects
- storing objects inside arrays

- Math object

## Primitive & Reference Types
- Primitive types (numbers, strings, Booleans, null, undefined, symbols) (6) (stored on the STACK)
- Reference types (all types of objects, object literals, arrays, functions, dates...) (stored on the HEAP)
