# What I learned?
# Objects
- Object Literals
- Dot Notation vs. Bracket Notation
- methods
- THIS (context object) (if it used in the root of the document, it will refer to the global context: window object)
- arrow functions work differently with the THIS keyword
(if an arrow function is used, JS does NOT change the value of THIS to the object)
